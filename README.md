# Ansible Collection - arensb.truenas

Manage a [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com/) machine.

## Included content

This collection consists primarily of a set of Ansible modules to
configure a TrueNAS machine, using the
[TrueNAS API](https://www.truenas.com/docs/api/websocket.html)
to control the Middleware Daemon.

It aims to be intuitive to use, and to avoid unpleasant surprises.

See [the online documentation](https://arensb.github.io/truenas/index.html)
for the list of included modules, and how to use them.

## Installing this collection

The easiest way to install this collection is
[through Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/arensb/truenas):

    ansible-galaxy collection install arensb.truenas

## Examples

    - name: Example tasks
      collections:
        - arensb.truenas
      hosts: truenas-box
      become: yes
      tasks:
        - name: Set the hostname
          hostname:
            name: new-hostname
        - name: Turn on sshd
          service:
            name: sshd

Note that since several of the module names are the same as builtin
ones, you may want to use the full name to avoid confusion:

    - hosts: truenas-box
      become: yes
      tasks:
        - arensb.truenas.hostname:
            name: new-hostname

## Environment Variables

### `middleware_method`

There are two ways of communicating with the middleware daemon on
TrueNAS, referred to here as `midclt` and `client`. `midclt` is older
and better-tested, while `client` is faster but less-well-tested. The
default is `client`.

Set the `middleware_method` environment variable to either `client` or
`midclt` at either the play or task level in your playbook to manually
select how this module communicates with the middleware daemon.

Example:

    - collections: arensb.truenas
      hosts: my-nas
      become: yes
      environment:
        middleware_method: client
      tasks:
        - name: Create a jail
          jail:
            name: my-jail
            release: 13.1-RELEASE
            state: running

## Contributing to this collection
The best way to contribute a patch or feature is to create a pull request.

If you'd like to write your own module, the `extras/template` file
provides a good starting point.

The [HACKING](HACKING.md) file has some tips on how to get around.
