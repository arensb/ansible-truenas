# Ansible Collection - arensb.truenas

Manage a [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com/) machine.

## Included content

This collection consists primarily of a set of Ansible modules to
configure a TrueNAS machine, using the
[TrueNAS API](https://www.truenas.com/docs/api/websocket.html)
to control the Middleware Daemon.

It aims to be intuitive to use, and to avoid unpleasant surprises.

See [the online documentation](https://arensb.github.io/truenas/index.html)
for the list of included modules, and how to use them.

## Installing this collection

The easiest way to install this collection is
[through Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/arensb/truenas):

    ansible-galaxy collection install arensb.truenas

## Examples

    - name: Example tasks
      collections:
        - arensb.truenas
      hosts: truenas-box
      become: yes
      tasks:
        - name: Set the hostname
          hostname:
            name: new-hostname
        - name: Turn on sshd
          service:
            name: sshd

Note that since several of the module names are the same as builtin
ones, you may want to use the full name to avoid confusion:

    - hosts: truenas-box
      become: yes
      tasks:
        - arensb.truenas.hostname:
            name: new-hostname

There is also support for the more modern websockets API; see below.

## Environment Variables

### `middleware_method`

There are two ways of communicating with the middleware daemon on
TrueNAS, referred to here as `midclt` and `client`. `midclt` is older
and better-tested, while `client` is faster but less-well-tested. The
default is `client`.

There is a third way of using websockets, referred to as `websocket`.
This is the way forward with the TrueNAS API, as the REST API is deprecated
starting in TrueNAS 25.04. Furthermore, the "legacy" websocket API is
24.10 and earlier, and the new JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket API is is 25.04
and later

This collection uses the [TrueNAS API client](https://github.com/truenas/api_client) to implement these websocket
modes.

To use the existing methods this collection has supported, set the
`middleware_method` environment variable to either `client` or
`midclt` at either the play or task level in your playbook to manually
select how this module communicates with the middleware daemon.

Example:

    - collections: arensb.truenas
      hosts: my-nas
      become: yes
      environment:
        middleware_method: client
      tasks:
        - name: Create a jail
          jail:
            name: my-jail
            release: 13.1-RELEASE
            state: running

To use the `websocket` method, set the `middleware_method` to `websocket`.
You need to run the playbook in a different way, as the websocket method now
runs on the controller, not by using the `midclt` binary or the `middlewared`
library on the remote.

Example:

    - name: Manually gather information
      collections: arensb.truenas
      hosts: localhost
      environment:
        middleware_method: websocket
        TRUENAS_API_USERNAME: admin
        TRUENAS_API_PASSWORD: testing
        TRUENAS_URI: ws://192.168.1.1

      gather_facts: no
      connection: local
      tasks:
        - name: Gather TrueNAS-specific facts
          arensb.truenas.truenas_facts:
        - debug: var=ansible_facts

### `TRUENAS_URI`

The URI of the TrueNAS machine. This is usually `ws://host.name.com`,
or maybe using `wss` if you have SSL set up. A trailing slash is or none
is fine.

### `TRUENAS_API_KEY`

The API key to use for authentication, as generated by the TrueNAS UI.  Use
either this or the username/password combination, but not both.

### `TRUENAS_API_USERNAME`

The username to use for authentication.

### `TRUENAS_API_PASSWORD`
The password to use for authentication.

If you'd like to write your own module, the `extras/template` file
provides a good starting point.

The [HACKING](HACKING.md) file has some tips on how to get around.
