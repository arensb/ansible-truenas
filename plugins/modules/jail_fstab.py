module: jail_fstab
short_description: "Manage a jail's fstab"
description:
  - Add, remove, mount, and unmount filesystems that a jail sees.
  - Note that changes can only be made when the jail is stopped,
    so this module will attempt to stop the jail if it needs to, and
    then restart it after the changes are made.
  - 'If you do not want production jails to be restarted without your
    explicit approval, you can add a clause like
    C(check_mode: "{{ restart_jails != ''yes'' }}")'
options:
  append:
    description:
      - If C(yes), other filesystems may be mounted besides the ones listed
        in C(fstab).
      - If C(no), any mounts other than the ones in C(fstab) will be removed.
    type: bool
    default: no
  jail:
    description:
      - Name of the jail
    type: str
    required: yes
  fstab:
    description:
      - List of mount points. Each element is a dictionary.
      - Most people will only need to specify C(src), C(mount), and
        C(options). The rest are advanced options.
    type: list

        description:
          - The device to mount, or the directory to share with the jail.
        required: yes
        type: str
      mount:
        description:
          - The directory where the device should be mounted.
          - This is a relative path, relative to the jail's root, typically
            C(/mnt/<pool>/iocage/jails/<jail-name>/root).
        required: yes
        type: str
      fstype:
        description:
          - Filesystem type.
          - When mounting an existing directory, use C(nullfs).
        type: str
        required: no
        default: "nullfs"
      options:
        description:
          - Filesystem options to pass to C(mount). Comma-separated string.
          - The most common values are C(ro) (read-only) and C(rw)
            (read-write).
        type: str
        default: "ro"
      dump:
        description:
          - Used by the C(dump) command. This field gives the number of
            days between backups. A value of 0 means "no backups".
          - This is the C(fs_freq) field in fstab(5).
          - For a jail, this will typically be 0.
        type: int
        required: no
        default: 0
      fsck_pass:
        description:
          - Used by C(fsck) to determine the order in which to check
            filesystems at boot time.
          - This is not normally useful in a jail. It is included here
            for completeness.
        type: int
        required: no
        default: 0
      state:
        description:
          - Whether the filesystem should be mounted or not.
          - Set C(state) to C(absent) to ensure that nothing is mounted
            at a given mount point.
          - By default, filesystems are mounted, because it is assumed that
            you want them available. In addition, setting C(append) to C(no)
            ensures that any filesystems not on the list are unmounted.
          - When C(state) is C(present), the C(source) parameter is required.
            When C(state) is C(absent), C(source) can be omitted.
        type: str
        choices: [ 'present', 'absent' ]

  description:
    - 'The fstab of the jail fstab. This is a dict of elements of the form

    - "C(IDX) is an integer string: the position of the entry in its fstab,
      zero-based."
    - C(source) is the device being mounted, or the directory being shared
      with the jail.
    - C(destination) is the directory where the filesystem is mounted.
      This is an absolute path as seen from outside the jail.
    - C(fstype) is the mount's filesystem type. For a null mount (filesystem
      shared with the jail), this is C(nullfs).
    - C(fsoptions) are the options passed to C(mount).
    - C(dump) and C(pass) are the dump and pass values from the C(fstab)
      entry.
    - C(type) specifies whether this is a system or user filesystem. In this
      module, it is always C("USER").
    - C(fstab) is returned in check mode as well.
