  threshold:
    description:
      - Minimum number of days between successful scrub tasks.
      - For instance, if you schedule a job to run every day, but set
        threshold to 7, the job will check every day to see whether
        it should run, but will only actually run once every 7 days.

      - This is a comma-separated list of integer ranges.
    type: str
  day:
    description:
