# XXX - Comparing schedules is harder than it looks: hour, day of the
# month, day of the week, month are all comma-separated lists of
# values.
#
# Hour can include ranges, e.g., "1-5,9-10".
#
# Likewise day of the month, e.g., "1-5,9-12".
#
# Day of the week is given as "sun", "mon", etc.
#
# Month is given as "jan", "feb", "mar", etc.
#
# The simple solution would be to just punt, and compare strings. That
# means that if the current cron job has "0 0 * * sun", but the caller
# has "weekday: 0" or "weekday: Sunday", that'll be seen as a change.
#
# This is probably good enough, at least for now. I'm not sure that
# normalizing cron times to compare them is worth the effort.

# XXX - There's no good way to delete all tasks and go back to a known
# blank slate. Maybe we want to change the rules if state==absent:
# don't require a name, schedule, or type, and delete anything that
# matches the given criteria.
#
# It's tempting to say that
#     - smart_test_task:
#         disks: ALL
#         state: absent
#
# should delete all jobs on all disks, but that might be a step too
# far. That should delete all jobs with 'all_disks' set.
#
# What if we have
#
#     - smart_test_task:
#         disks: ada0
#         state: absent
#
# and there's a matching job that runs on [ ada0, ada1 ]? In this
# case, the sensible thing to do might be to just edit the job and
# remove ada0.
