        but not removed from any other groups.
      - If false, the user will be added to the groups listed in C(groups),
        and removed from any other groups.
    type: bool
    default: false
  append_pubkeys:
    description:
      - If true, the keys specified in C(ssh_authorized_keys) will be added
        to the user's C(~/.ssh/authorized_keys), but any others that might
        be there will not be removed.
      - If false, any keys not explicitly listed in C(ssh_authorized_keys)
        will be removed from the user's C(~/.ssh/authorized_keys).
    type: bool
    default: false
  comment:
    description:
      - The full name (I(GECOS) field) of the user.
    type: str
    default: ""
  create_group:
    description:
      - If true, create a new group with the same name as the user.
      - If such a group already exists, it is used and no new group is
        created.
    type: bool
    default: true
  delete_group:
    description:
      - If true, delete the user's primary group if it is not being used
        by any other users.
      - If false, the primary group stays, even if it is now empty.
      - Only used when deleting a user.
    type: bool
    default: true
  email:
    description:
      - User's email address, in the form I(user@dom.ain).
    type: str
  group:
    description:
      - The name of the user's primary group.
      - Required unless C(create_group) is true.
    type: str
  groups:
    description:
      - List of additional groups user will be added to.
      - If C(append) is true, the user will be added to all of the groups
        listed here.
      - If C(append) is false, then in addition, the user will be removed
        from all other groups (except the primary).
    type: list
  home:
    description:
      - User's home directory.
      - Note that TrueNAS has restrictions on what this can be. As of this
        writing, the home directory has to begin with "/mnt", or be
        "/nonexistent".
      - Note that if you create a user with home directory C("/nonexistent"),
        then later change it to a real directory, that directory will not
        be populated with dot files.
      - "Note: If you create an account with a home directory that does not
        end in the username (e.g., if C(name: bob) and
        C(home: /mnt/pool0/homes)), TrueNAS will append the username to
        form the real home directory (C(/mnt/pool0/homes/bob), in this
        example). This is not recommended. It is better to use the full
        home directory, ending with the username."
  name:
    description:
      - Name of the user to manage.
    type: str
    required: true
    aliases: [ user ]
  password:
    description:
      - User's password, as a crypted string.
      - Required unless C(password_disabled) is true.
      - "Note: Currently there is no way to check whether the password
        needs to be changed, so this is used only when the user is created."
    type: str
  password_disabled:
    description:
      - If true, the user's password is disabled.
      - They can still log in through other methods (e.g., ssh key).
      - "This is not a flag: if you set C(password_disabled=true) on a user,
        the password field in C(/etc/master.passwd) is set to C(*), so
        if you set C(password_disabled=false) again, they won't be able to
        log in with their old password."
      - If you need that functionality, do something like prepend "*LOCK*"
        to the crypt string when locking a user, then remove it when
        unlocking.
    type: bool
    default: false
  shell:
    description:
      - User's shell.

      - Whether the user is allowed to sudo (see also I(sudo_nopasswd) and
        I(sudo_commands)).
      - "Note: this defaults to false. So if you create a user with
        I(sudo: yes), then comment out that line, the user will be removed
        from sudo."
    type: bool
  sudo_nopasswd:
    description:
      - Deprecated. Use I(sudo_commands_nopasswd) instead.
      - Allows user to sudo without a password.
    type: bool
    default: false
  sudo_commands:
    description:
      - List of commands the user is allowed to execute using C(sudo).
      - Each command must use an absolute path, except for the special
        value "ALL", which allows executing any command.
      - Commands may include options, e.g., C("/bin/ls -l").
      - In TrueNAS CORE, and in older versions of SCALE, only one of
