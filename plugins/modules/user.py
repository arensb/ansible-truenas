  home:
    description:
      - User's home directory.
      - Note that TrueNAS has restrictions on what this can be. As of this
        writing, the home directory has to begin with "/mnt", or be
        "/nonexistent".
      - Note that if you create a user with home directory C("/nonexistent"),
        then later change it to a real directory, that directory will not
        be populated with dot files.
      - "Note: If you create an account with a home directory that does not
        end in the username (e.g., if C(name: bob) and
        C(home: /mnt/pool0/homes)), TrueNAS will append the username to
        form the real home directory (C(/mnt/pool0/homes/bob), in this
        example). This is not recommended. It is better to use the full
        home directory, ending with the username."

        the password field in C(/etc/master.passwd) is set to C(*), so
        if you set C(password_disabled=false) again, they won't be able to
        log in with their old password."
      - If you need that functionality, do something like prepend "*LOCK*"
        to the crypt string when locking a user, then remove it when
        unlocking.
      - "Note that under TrueNAS SCALE, a user with C(password_disabled)
