  - Creates, deletes, and configures disk pool snapshot tasks.
options:

        When true, empty snapshots may be created. This can be useful when
        there are two overlapping sets of snapshots, e.g., a daily set
        and a weekly set: the weekly snapshot may be empty because the daily
        one already contains the changes to the filesystem, but you still
        want to keep the weekly snapshot when the daily one has expired.
    type: bool
  begin_time:
    description:
      - Time at which to begin taking snapshots. This is a string in
        the form "HH:MM"

      - The name of the dataset to snapshot. This can be a pool, ZFS
        dataset, or zvol.

    description:
      - Whether this snapshot task is enabled.

    type: str
  exclude:
    description:
      - A list of child datasets to exclude from snapshotting.
      - If a snapshot task is non-recursive, it may not have an exclude
        list, so if you specify a non-empty exclude list to a non-recursive
        task, this module will silently clear it.
    type: list
    elements: str
  lifetime_unit:
    description:
      - |
        A unit of time for the snapshot lifetime before it is deleted.
        One of the following units of time:
        C(hour), C(day), C(week), C(month), C(year),
        optionally pluralized.
      - Along with C(lifetime_value), specifies the length of time a
        snapshot will be kept before being deleted.
    type: str
    choices: [ hour, hours, day, days, week, weeks, month, months, year, years ]
  lifetime_value:
    description:
      - The number of units of time that the snapshot will exist before
        it is deleted. Used in conjunction with C(lifetime_unit).
    type: int
  match:
    description:
      - A snapshot task does not have a name or other visible unique
        identifier, so the C(match) option provides a way of specifying
        which of several tasks the play is configuring, as well as
        telling whether the task exists yet or not.
      - The C(match) option is a dict with one or more keywords
        identifying the task. At least one must be provided.
      - If the C(state) option is C(present), only the first matching
        dataset will be updated. If C(state) is C(absent), all matching
        datasets will be deleted.
    required: true

      dataset:
        description:
          - Name of the dataset being snapshotted. This can be a pool,
            dataset, or zvol.
        type: str
      name_format:
        description:
          - |
            This is a regular expression that the C(name_format) option must
            match. The idea being that you can name your snapshots something
            like C(daily-%Y%m%d), and identify them by the prefix, using
            C(name_format: ^daily-).
        type: str
  name_format:
    description:
      - |
        A template specifying the name of the snapshot. This must include
        the strings "%Y", "%m", "%d", "%H", and "%M". Their meanings are
        as in C(strftime): year, month, date, hour, and minute.
        Other C(strftime) sequences may also be included.
