# The TrueNAS middleware can be controlled in different ways: through
# the 'midclt' command-line tool, through a REST API, maybe others.
# The REST API is the recommended one.
#
# Since all of these methods provide the same functions, take the same
# arguments, and return the same results, we want users to be able to
# choose the one that works best for them. This module is a layer that
# sits between individual modules and the middleware, and uses
# whichever access method is chosen.
