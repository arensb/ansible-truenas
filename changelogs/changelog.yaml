  1.10.1:
    changes:

      - Better error-handling. Try to recognize when the caller has invoked a nonexistent
        function, as opposed to some other error.

      - Better tolerance for error in setup. If some fact isn't defined, try to carry
        on.
      release_summary: Fix setup failing due to differences between TrueNAS CORE and
        SCALE.
    fragments:

      bugfixes:
      - Typo in command-line option for 'midclt', which prevented it from launching

    fragments:

  1.4.5:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - The C(sudo) and C(sudo_nopasswd) options are deprecated.
      bugfixes:
      - user module sudo variables didn't work with recent versions of TrueNAS SCALE.
      deprecated_features:
      - In the user module, C(sudo) and C(sudo_nopasswd) options are deprecated. The
        C(sudo_commands) and C(sudo_commands_nopasswd) options are the preferred way
        to specify sudo permissions.
      release_summary: Fix the way sudo is handled for users.
    release_date: '2023-06-20'
  1.5.0:
    changes:
      major_changes:
      - Added the C(pool_snapshot_task) module, which manages periodic snapshot tasks
        for ZFS volumes.
      release_summary: add ZFS snapshot tasks
    release_date: '2023-06-23'
  1.5.1:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - Fix formatting in docstrings, so docs should generate better now.
      release_summary: fix docstrings
    release_date: '2023-06-23'
  1.5.2:
    release_date: '2023-07-01'
  1.6.0:
    changes:
      major_changes:
      - For now, the old behavior is still the default. To use the new behavior, set
        the "middleware_method" environment variable to "client", at either the play,
        block, or task level, using the "environment:" Ansible directive.
      - The default behavior will be switched from "midclt" to "client" in a later
        version.
      - Up until now, these modules have been invoking the 'midclt' utility on the
        TrueNAS client to communicate with the middleware daemon. But that is implemented
        using a Python module. This release makes it possible to use that Python module
        directly, resulting in a significant speed improvement (as well as simpler
        code).
      release_summary: Use native client code on the TrueNAS machine.

  1.9.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - TrueNAS SCALE doesn't allow enabling SMB access on users without a password.
        'smb' used to default to true, which prevented creating users with password
        disabled. The 'smb' argument can now be set explicitly.
      major_changes:
      - Add user "smb" parameter to control SMB access.
      release_summary: Bug fix.

    - user.yml

  1.9.2:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - TrueNAS CORE and SCALE have different flags for NFS versions 3 and 4. SCALE
        allows turning each one on and off independently. CORE only supports this
        for v4. This change updates the nfs module to enable each protocol separately,
        where possible.
      release_summary: Support NFSv4 under TrueNAS SCALE
    fragments:
    - nfsv4.yml
    release_date: '2024-05-17'
